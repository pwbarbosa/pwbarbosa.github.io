                    <h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
                    <p>It all started in Feira de Santana in the state of Bahia in Brazil where I was born to a Brazilian father and an American mother, and we moved to the US before I was even a year old. Growing up, we moved a lot. Before college, I had lived in Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia, West Virginia, Kansas, and Illinois. 
                        Throughout my time in school, I was involved in various sports, concert band and marching band, choirs, plays and musicals, and the oh-so-fun brain bowls.
                        My undergraduate degree from Northern Illinois University was a Bachelor of Arts that focused on music, theatre, and dance training. For many years, I was involved in various professional plays and musicals in Chicago and across the Midwest. At LSU, I earned a Master of Music in Operatic Vocal Performance.
                        In the middle of my time at LSU, I met my wife, Dana Pundt, while we were involved in an opera contract in Des Moines, Iowa.
                        From there, we moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where we continued to persue operatic careers, and rear two beautiful young girls.</p>

                    <h3>Opera</h3>
                    <p>As far back as I can remember, I have been exposed to a broad range of music from all over the world. Growing up, I enjoyed a rich musical heritage, from both my Brazilian side and from my mother, who is a retired classically trained singer and voice professor. Growing up, I was involved in children's chorus throughout elementary school, youth choir at my church during junior high, chamber choir and show choir in high school, as well as regional and state competion choir. Getting my degrees in performance and voice was a natural outgrowth from a life-long musical path.
                        As soon as I finished my B.A. in Music, Theatre and Dance from N.I.U., I moved to Chicago, where I had the opportunity to work locally in play and musicals, as well as earn bigger regional musical theatre venues in Oklahoma.
                        Over time, I came to realize that performing opera was really what I wanted to do, so I moved from Chicago to Baton Rouge, and earned my M.M. in Operatic Vocal Performance from L.S.U. 
                        Before I had graduated, I gained contracts with two big companies in the lower Midwest, and after graduation, I had a career that was really starting to take off just as the COVID-19 pandemic started, performing with many companies between the Midwest and the East Coast.
                        Although I still perform, it is not the same as it was before COVID, and I know longer treat it as a main source of income.</p>

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>The pandemic made my wife, who is also an opera singer, and I take a hard look at how we approach providing for our family. At the beginning, I started down a medical path: Taking nursing classes and becoming an EMT. But after only a year and a half working for private ambulance companies, I began to burn out.
                        One of the times I contracted COVID, I had a lot of extra time to consider options and things that made me happy when I was younger. I recalled a pottery class I used to take at one of the colleges where my mom taught. At the end of each class, while I was waiting to be picked up, my instructor would teach me HTML. This was back in 1996, when CSS was just taking off. I remembered that I loved making rudimentary Star Trek: The Next Generation appreciation pages with cool graphics.
                        So, I started taking whatever free coding courses I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the learning, and the creating. Over the next few months, I had learning some basic C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As I went back to work, it was very challenging to find time to continue my learning, so I took the bootcamp plunge!
                        The next step would be to attend a remote Full-Stack bootcamp with We Can Code IT. Through them I gained valuable skills which I am eager to combine with all the skills I have developed along the way, persevering in a career in performance!</p>
